There are two #defines in the beginning of the header file : 'linked_array.h' which may be updated to expand the limits of the program.

The initial limits are set to 1000 Lists with a maximum of 1000 nodes in total.

MAX : the maximum number of links that can be created. 
No_Of_Nodes : the maximum number of objects as defined in the assignment statement that can be accepted.
